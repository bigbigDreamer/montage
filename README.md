# Montage

## Definition

>Montage means "splicing" in French, but in Russia, it has been developed into a theory of lens combination in films. Montage is also a unique artistic technique and the meaning of Freestyle painting in the paint and coating industry.

>When different shots are stitched together, they often in turn create specific meanings that the individual shots do not have when they stand alone. Writing using this method of writing is also called the montage technique.

## Diffraction

`pnpm` + `changeset` + `rollup` + `esbuild` build `monorepo` of the pilot field.

> `mono` means `unicellular multinuclear`

## Todolist

- [x] Use `dumi` as repo docs framework.
- [x] Use `pnpm` & `changeset` replace `lerna`.
- [x] Use `github action` auto build docs.
- [x] Use `esbuild`„ÄÅ`swc` build components.
- [ ] Use `husky` & `eslint` & `prettier` standard code style.
- [ ] Try `vuepress` refactor docs site.
- [ ] Try [`Rush`](https://rushjs.io/) refactor `changeset`.
